\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
Computer simulations are widely used in science and engineering to model complex systems and phenomena. 
They allow researchers to analyze and predict the behavior of systems under various conditions,
providing insights that may be difficult or impossible to obtain through traditional experimental methods.
The problem given an of oil spills has a real world implementation and are of significant for environmental concern. There are multiple examples like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, where computational simulations was crucial in order to predict where surface oil would go, aiding skimming, booming, and shoreline protection.

Our simulation aims to model oil trajectory and spread forecasting in Bay city.
Outside Bay city is a fishing ground that are voulnerable to oil spills.
This report will discuss the mathematical models used to represent the oil spill dynamics,
the numerical methods to solve these models, and the implementation of the simulation.

\chapter{Agile development}
Agile development is an iterative approach to software creation that emphasizes flexibility and
collaboration. The main idea is breaking a complex problem into smaller parts.  
Through small, frequent releases of working software, 
the strategy will produce results that are getting closer and closer to achieve the end goal.

\section{Story map and 3rd party software}
Our approach implementing agile development was firstly to clarify expectations to eachother working in a group.
Secondly, we spent the first days reading and understanding the problem thoroughly. 
By breaking the problem down to smaller pieces, we got a clear idea about what solutions
the problem would require. By identifying this, we structured the work by creating a story map.
\subsection{StoriesOnBoard}
We used a 3rd party software from https://StoriesOnBoard.com with a 14 days free trail in order facilitate this. 
We chose StoriesOnBoard because it offerd a lot more than native github projects, it had a nice layout, user firendly gui, and the ability to integrate with GitHub. 
Focusing on documentation, organizing the main structre, we achieved a foundtation to start tackeling the problem. 
Applying timelines and sprints, we also gained an idea to when certian taskes was supposed to be done.

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/StoryBoard.png}

    \label{fig:Story map}
\end{figure}

Our story map follows a traditional setup with Epics at the top, user stories on the second level  and the taskes bellow.
The tasks were assigned under a Sprint that was set with duration of 5 days. 
The tasks emphasizes detailed decription, rather then a big quantity of tasks in order to have a clear overview in the Story map.
